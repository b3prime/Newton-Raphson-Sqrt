# Newton-Raphson-Sqrt
Program created in May of 2021. Uploaded to GitHub 4/6/2023

This is a Python program that uses the Newton-Raphson method to calculate square-roots.

By creating a function with the roots equaling the solution, ex. f(x) = x^2-5, we can use tangent lines to iteratively converge to the solution.
